# ML-WebThreat-Collection  
A curated collection of machine learning datasets, models, and experiments for web threat detection.

## Overview  
This repository gathers datasets, baseline models, and workflows aimed at detecting various web threats, such as malicious domains, web shells, injected scripts, and more. It serves as a **foundation repository** for developing and comparing ML models in web-security scenarios.

## What this repository contains  
- **Datasets**: raw and processed data for threats (domains, code snippets, network flows) ready for modeling.  
- **Baseline Models**: reference implementations (CNNs, logistic regression, transformer-based ML) to demonstrate initial threat detection performance.  
- **Experiments / Scripts**: end-to-end pipelines covering data loading, feature extraction, model training, evaluation, and inference.

## Installation & Setup  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/FlorenceOTATO-index/ml-webthreat-collection.git
cd ml-webthreat-collection
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
